# Pizza Party 🍕🤤

Wout loves making pizza and is always looking for new recipes. Want to help him out? Find out how in [this repository's wiki](https://github.com/WoutDLN/pizzaParty/wiki). 

## About 

This repository was designed as a sandbox environment for students who want to feel comfortable working with git and GitHub. 
For a low-threshold introduction to git and GitHub, including a quick introduction to this repository, a live run-through of some of the commands of your basic git and GitHub workflows, and definitions of concepts like `fork`, `commit`, `push`, and `pull request`, be sure to check out [this repository's accompanying video lecture](https://play.hb.se/media/0_mvgov641).

## Credits

This repository was originally developed by [Wout Dillen](https://github.com/WoutDLN) to be used in his slightly more advanced class [Getting Started With Git(Hub)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQ--0Og1PqneJQ5yWZtdSfLI1MAPmg394irXhiPa1edlE9a2GH7p3S-6dOqYd7vzll4jQ2hMvOxxYIN/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) in the Bootcamp course of the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be)'s [MA in Digital Text Analysis](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/study/programmes/all-programmes/digital-text-analysis/). 

[Wout has since remodelled the repository](https://github.com/WoutDLN/pizzaParty/releases/tag/v2.0.0) in view of teaching his Library and Information Science students the basics of git and GitHub in the Digitizing Cultural Heritage Materials (DCHM) course at the [University of Borås](https://www.hb.se/) (Sweden), where he currently works as a Senior Lecturer. The repository is currently also being used in another one of Wout's classes at the University of Borås: Datalogical Thinking.

Special thanks go to the students of the DCHM course who took part in the residential weeks of 2022 and 2023, and to the students of the Datalogical Thinking course for being Wout's guinea pigs.
